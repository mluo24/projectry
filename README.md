# Projectry

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Information
**Note: this project was forked from taerimeom, as a collaboration for the final project of INFO 1998: Trends in Web Development.**

Projectry aims to pair people who have ideas for projects up with those who are interested in working on them! Users may sign up with their Google accounts and browse the available projects other people have posted and view their descriptions. 

Though not implemented yet, potential (previously) planned expansions include:
- Comment system on projects
- Review system for the users and project owners
- Messaging system between users and project owners for communication and interest

Frontend was made with React, backend was made with Node.js, and Firebase was database used
